King Charles was seen for the first time since announcing his cancer diagnosis, which was revealed after Prince Harry's visit to the UK. The King and Queen departed from London's Clarence House. They are both now residing at Sandringham in Norfolk. Harry arrived after a flight from the US, while Meghan is expected to stay in the US.

Few details about Charles' diagnosis were disclosed, only that it was related to a recent procedure for an enlarged prostate. Both sons were informed prior to the announcement.  The King and Queen waved as they left London.
